# waht is the diff b/w the html element and the html tags?

HTML tags - tags are the syntax that you used to write the html code, So when we write the code we write in the form of tags.

HTML element - Now the tags rendered on the browser it become the html element , so what ever we see on the browser is the tags getting rendered in the browser.
